# YAMV
Yet Another Map Viewer.

## What is it ?
A map, using [Google Maps JS API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) to visualise data from our geo-aggregator.

## How do I use it?

You need [YAGA](https://github.com/BigStructureTeam/YAGA) to generate and receive data.


See [Wiki](https://github.com/BigStructureTeam/YAMV/wiki) for more information about YAMV UX/UI.
